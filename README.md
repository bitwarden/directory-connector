## Command-line Interface

A command-line interface tool is also available for the Bitwarden Directory Connector. The Directory Connector CLI (`bwdc`) is written with TypeScript and Node.js and can also be run on Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions.

## CLI Documentation

The Bitwarden Directory Connector CLI is self-documented with `--help` content and examples for every command. You should start exploring the CLI by using the global `--help` option:

```bash
bwdc --help
```

This option will list all available commands that you can use with the Directory Connector CLI.

Additionally, you can run the `--help` option on a specific command to learn more about it:

```
bwdc test --help
bwdc config --help
```

**Detailed Documentation**

We provide detailed documentation and examples for using the Directory Connector CLI in our help center at https://help.bitwarden.com/article/directory-sync/#command-line-interface.

## Build/Run

**Requirements**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Windows users: To compile the native node modules used in the app you will need the Visual C++ toolset, available through the standard Visual Studio installer (recommended) or by installing [`windows-build-tools`](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) through `npm`. See more at [Compiling native Addon modules](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejs-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md#compiling-native-addon-modules).

**Run the app**

```bash
npm install
npm run reset # Only necessary if you have previously run the CLI app
npm run rebuild
npm run electron
```

**Run the CLI**

```bash
npm install
npm run reset # Only necessary if you have previously run the desktop app
npm run build:cli:watch
```

You can then run commands from the `./build-cli` folder:

```bash
node ./build-cli/bwdc.js --help
```
